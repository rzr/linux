* bq2419x charger devicetree bindings

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be from the list
  ti,bq2419x
                          to be drawn by the charger from the power source.

Required nodes:
- regulators: There must a regulator subnode each for the following purposes:
              (1) Setting battery charging current.
              (2) Enabling current supply to vbus (To enable otg mode)
              Each of these regulator nodes must have atleast one consumer
              subnode which in turn must have certain mandatory properties
              supplied. To know about these mandatory properties and more about
              consumer subnodes, please refer
              Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt

Additional properties to be added to charger regulator subnode:

Required properties:
- auto-recharge-time      : Time interval in seconds after which the charging
                            should be restarted after the charging is complete.

Optional properties:
- watchdog-timeout        : Watchdog timer expiry timeout value in seconds.
                            When not specified, watchdog timer functionality
                            will be disabled.
- rtc-alarm-time          : Time setting in seconds for the rtc alarm timer
                            which wakes the board up for charging after shutdown.

Subnode properties:
==================
There is two optional subnodes, vbus and charger.

vbus properties:
================
otg-iusb-gpio-isub-gpio: The GPIO which is connected to OTG/IUSB pin.
